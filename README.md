## Description

The E-commerce Back-End is a backend application that provides the necessary API endpoints for managing an e-commerce website. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products, categories, and tags. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for interacting with the MySQL database.
